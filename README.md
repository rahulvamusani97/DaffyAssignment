# Typeahead Challenge

## Description

Create an iOS app with a typeahead, using an API of your choice. The typeahead should update a list of results based on the search query, as the user types. You can use any API, but here are some suggestions:

- [The Movie Database](https://github.com/adamayoung/TMDb) (movies, TV shows)
- [Google Places](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/ios-sdk) (locations, restaurants, other points of interest)

If you are using The Movie Database, and/or want a starting point, feel free to use the workspace provided in this repository. You can edit and add to the starter code provided, and are not obligated to use any of it.

## Requirements

1. App that can be successfully built and run, and is written in Swift with UIKit
2. Screen with search bar and list of all items, that are filtered down based on the search query
3. Tapping on an item takes you to a detail screen for that item, with the ability to go back to the list
4. Put your submission up on Github, with a README including anything needed to build your app

Submission will be judged on your understanding of iOS/Swift concepts, architectural decisions, and attention to detail. This is meant to be small in scope to assess where you’re at in your iOS journey—but feel free to get creative with it if you have time!
